## Generated implementation

A disabled metadata adapter was generated at `generated/adapters/ticoteam-tico.json`.
It contains normalized MCP/tool/skill metadata and compatibility hints. It cannot install or execute upstream code.

## Activation checklist

- [ ] Confirm maintainer and license provenance.
- [ ] Review every static-security finding.
- [ ] Pin an immutable upstream revision.
- [ ] Run upstream code only in an isolated, disposable sandbox.
- [ ] Add repository-owned adapter tests.
- [ ] Approve least-privilege credentials and network access.
- [ ] Enable the adapter in a separate reviewed pull request.

## Safety invariants

- Upstream code executed during discovery: **no**
- Upstream dependencies installed during discovery: **no**
- Automatic merge: **no**
- Human approval required before activation: **yes**
